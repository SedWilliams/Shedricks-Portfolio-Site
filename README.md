One of the first out of a few projects I've built to completion (it will always be changing). This project gave me lots of awareness and knowledge, of all the things that I don't know. And because of that I gained a rather large list of possible directions to go in my software learning journey. [See which direction I ended up choosing here.](https://www.youtube.com/@shedrickwilliams4175/videos)
